    optimal_traditional_de(s, method = "ifnn", dmethod = "mi_min"; kwargs...) ‚Üí ùíü, œÑ

Produce an optimal delay embedding `ùíü` of the given timeseries `s` by
using the traditional approach of first finding an optimal (and constant) delay time using
[`estimate_delay`](@ref) with the given `dmethod`, and then an optimal embedding dimension.
Return the embedding `ùíü` and the optimal delay time `œÑ` (the optimal embedding dimension
is just `size(ùíü, 2)`).

For estimating the dimension we use the given `method`, which can be:

* `"ifnn"` is the "Improved False Nearest Neighbors" from Hegger & Kantz[^Hegger1999],
    which gives the fraction of false nearest neighbors. This fraction goes to 0
    after the optimal embedding dimension. This is the best method.
* `"afnn"` (default) is Cao's "Averaged False Nearest Neighbors" method[^Cao1997], which
    gives a ratio of distances between nearest neighbors. This ratio saturates
    around `1.0` near the optimal value of `Œ≥` (see [`afnn`](@ref)).
* `"fnn"` is Kennel's "False Nearest Neighbors" method[^Kennel1992], which gives the
    number of points that cease to be "nearest neighbors" when the dimension
    increases. This number drops down to zero near the optimal value of `Œ≥`.
    This method accepts the keyword arguments `rtol` and `atol`, which stand
    for the "tolerances" required by Kennel's algorithm (see [`fnn`](@ref)).
* `"f1nn"` is Krakovsk√°'s "False First Nearest Neighbors" method[^Krakovsk√°2015], which
    gives the ratio of pairs of points that cease to be "nearest neighbors"
    when the dimension increases. This number drops down to zero near the
    optimal embedding dimension (see [`f1nn`](@ref)). This is the worse method.

`"afnn"` and `"f1nn"` also support the `metric` keyword, which can be any of
`Cityblock(), Euclidean(), Chebyshev()`. This metric is used both
for computing the nearest neighbors (`KDTree`s) as well as the distances necessary for
Cao's method (eqs. (2, 3) of [1]). Defaults to `Euclidean()` (note that [1] used
`Chebyshev`).

function optimal_traditional_de(s::AbstractVector, method::String = "ifnn", ;
    delay::String = "mi_min", œÑs = 1:min(100, length(s)), kwargs...)

Compute the reconstructed trajectory `Y` from a time series `s` using the
standard time delay embedding. You can choose various combinations of the delay
estimators `delaymethod` (Default is "mi_min") and embedding dimension estimators
(Default is "afnn").

You can choose delay estimators from [`estimate_delay`](@ref):
* `"mi_min"` : delay of first minimum of mutual information of `s` with itself
  (shifted for various `œÑs`). <- Default
* `"ac_zero"` : first delay at which the auto-correlation function becomes <0.
* `"ac_min"` : delay of first minimum of the auto-correlation function.

You can choose embedding estimators from [`estimate_dimension`](@ref):
* `"afnn"` : Cao's method [`afnn`](@ref). <- Default
* `"fnn"`  : Kennel et al.'s traditional method [`fnn`](@ref)
* `"ifnn"` : improved fnn-method by Hegger & Kantz [`ifnn`](@ref)
* `"f1nn"` : delay of first minimum of the auto-correlation function.

Keyword arguments:
*`thres = 0.05`: This threshold determines the tolerable deviation of the
    proposed statistic from the optimal value of 1 (in case of "afnn") or 0 (in
    case of the other dimension estimators), for breaking the algorithm.
*`dmax = 10`: The maximum embedding dimension, which is encountered by the
    algorithm.
*`w = 1`: The Theiler window, which excludes temporally correlated points from
    the nearest neighbor search (does only work for "afnn", yet).
*`rtol = 10.`: threshold for the relative increment of the distance between the
    nearest neighbors in case of "fnn"
*`atol = 2.`: another threshold for the ratio between the increased distance and
    the "size of the attractor" in case of "fnn"
*`r = 2`:  Obligatory threshold, which determines the maximum tolerable spreading
    of trajectories in the reconstruction space in case of "ifnn".

## Description
Given the scalar timeseries `s` and the requested delay and dimension estimator
methods, this function returns the reconstruction vectors `Y`, given the threshold
`thres`. When this threshold is exceeded, the algorithm breaks. In case of "afnn"
also the [`stochastic_indicator`](@ref) gets checked. Also returns the picked
delay `œÑ` and the statistic `d_statistic`, according to the chosen dimension
estimation method.

*Note that `thres` needs to be adapted in case of noise contamination of the
input data, otherwise it will not terminate/ give a valid embedding*
