    optimal_traditional_de(s, method = "ifnn", dmethod = "mi_min"; kwargs...) ‚Üí ùíü, œÑ

Produce an optimal delay embedding `ùíü` of the given timeseries `s` by
using the traditional approach of first finding an optimal (and constant) delay time using
[`estimate_delay`](@ref) with the given `dmethod`, and then an optimal embedding dimension.
Return the embedding `ùíü` and the optimal delay time `œÑ` (the optimal embedding dimension
is just `size(ùíü, 2)`).

For estimating the dimension we use the given `method`, which can be:

* `"ifnn"` is the "Improved False Nearest Neighbors" from Hegger & Kantz[^Hegger1999],
    which gives the fraction of false nearest neighbors. This fraction goes to 0
    after the optimal embedding dimension. This is the best method.
* `"afnn"` (default) is Cao's "Averaged False Nearest Neighbors" method[^Cao1997], which
    gives a ratio of distances between nearest neighbors. This ratio saturates
    around `1.0` near the optimal value of `Œ≥` (see [`afnn`](@ref)).
* `"fnn"` is Kennel's "False Nearest Neighbors" method[^Kennel1992], which gives the
    number of points that cease to be "nearest neighbors" when the dimension
    increases. This number drops down to zero near the optimal value of `Œ≥`.
    This method accepts the keyword arguments `rtol` and `atol`, which stand
    for the "tolerances" required by Kennel's algorithm (see [`fnn`](@ref)).
* `"f1nn"` is Krakovsk√°'s "False First Nearest Neighbors" method[^Krakovsk√°2015], which
    gives the ratio of pairs of points that cease to be "nearest neighbors"
    when the dimension increases. This number drops down to zero near the
    optimal embedding dimension (see [`f1nn`](@ref)). This is the worse method.

`"afnn"` and `"f1nn"` also support the `metric` keyword, which can be any of
`Cityblock(), Euclidean(), Chebyshev()`. This metric is used both
for computing the nearest neighbors (`KDTree`s) as well as the distances necessary for
Cao's method (eqs. (2, 3) of [1]). Defaults to `Euclidean()` (note that [1] used
`Chebyshev`).
