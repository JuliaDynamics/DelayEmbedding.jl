    estimate_dimension(s::AbstractVector, τ::Int, γs = 1:5, method = "afnn"; kwargs...)

Compute a quantity that can estimate an optimal amount of
temporal neighbors `γ` to be used in [`reconstruct`](@ref) or [`embed`](@ref).

## Description
Given the scalar timeseries `s` and the embedding delay `τ` compute a quantity
for each `γ ∈ γs` based on the "nearest neighbors" in the embedded time series.

The quantity that is calculated depends on the algorithm defined by the string `method`:

* `"afnn"` (default) is Cao's "Averaged False Nearest Neighbors" method [1], which
    gives a ratio of distances between nearest neighbors. This ratio saturates
    around `1.0` near the optimal value of `γ` (see [`afnn`](@ref)).
* `"fnn"` is Kennel's "False Nearest Neighbors" method [2], which gives the
    number of points that cease to be "nearest neighbors" when the dimension
    increases. This number drops down to zero near the optimal value of `γ`.
    This method accepts the keyword arguments `rtol` and `atol`, which stand
    for the "tolerances" required by Kennel's algorithm (see [`fnn`](@ref)).
* `"f1nn"` is Krakovská's "False First Nearest Neighbors" method [3], which
    gives the ratio of pairs of points that cease to be "nearest neighbors"
    when the dimension increases. This number drops down to zero near the
    optimal value of `γ` (see [`f1nn`](@ref)).

Please be aware that in **DynamicalSystems.jl** `γ` stands for the amount of temporal
neighbors and not the embedding dimension (`D = γ + 1`, see also [`embed`](@ref)).

    afnn(s::AbstractVector, τ:Int, γs = 1:5, p = Inf)

Compute the parameter E₁ of Cao's "averaged false nearest neighbors" method for
determining the minimum embedding dimension of the time series `s`, with
a sequence of `τ`-delayed temporal neighbors [1].

## Description
Given the scalar timeseries `s` and the embedding delay `τ` compute the
values of `E₁` for each `γ ∈ γs`, according to Cao's Method (eq. 3 of [1]).

This quantity is a ratio of the averaged distances between the nearest neighbors
of the reconstructed time series, which quantifies the increment of those
distances when the number of temporal neighbors changes from `γ` to `γ+1`.

Please be aware that in **DynamicalSystems.jl** `γ` stands for the amount of temporal
neighbors and not the embedding dimension (`D = γ + 1`, see also [`embed`](@ref)).

Return the vector of all computed `E₁`s. To estimate a good value for `γ` from this,
find `γ` for which the value `E₁` saturates at some value around 1.

*Note: This method does not work for datasets with perfectly periodic signals.*

    stochastic_indicator(s::AbstractVector, τ:Int, γs = 1:4) -> E₂s

Compute an estimator for apparent randomness in a reconstruction with `γs` temporal
neighbors.

## Description
Given the scalar timeseries `s` and the embedding delay `τ` compute the
values of `E₂` for each `γ ∈ γs`, according to Cao's Method (eq. 5 of [1]).

Use this function to confirm that the

    fnn(s::AbstractVector, τ:Int, γs = 1:5; rtol=10., atol=2.)

Calculate the number of "false nearest neighbors" (FNN) of the datasets created
from `s` with a sequence of `τ`-delayed temporal neighbors.

## Description
Given a dataset made by embedding `s` with `γ` temporal neighbors and delay `τ`,
the "false nearest neighbors" (FNN) are the pairs of points that are nearest to
each other at dimension `γ`, but are separated at dimension `γ+1`. Kennel's
criteria for detecting FNN are based on a threshold for the relative increment
of the distance between the nearest neighbors (`rtol`, eq. 4 in [1]), and
another threshold for the ratio between the increased distance and the
"size of the attractor" (`atol`, eq. 5 in [1]). These thresholds are given
as keyword arguments.

The returned value is a vector with the number of FNN for each `γ ∈ γs`. The
optimal value for `γ` is found at the point where the number of FNN approaches
zero.

Please be aware that in **DynamicalSystems.jl** `γ` stands for the amount of temporal
neighbors and not the embedding dimension (`D = γ + 1`, see also [`embed`](@ref)).

## Description
Given a dataset made by embedding `s` with `γ` temporal neighbors and delay `τ`,
