...Garcia & Almeida [^Garcia2005a]
(Nearest neighbor embedding with different time delays),
Garcia & Almeida [^Garcia2005b] (Multivariate phase space reconstruction by
nearest neighbor embedding with different time delays)
for a phase space trajectory `Y` (timeseries or `Dataset`). ...

## Keyword arguments

* `SampleSize = .5`: Number of considered fiducial points v as a fraction of
  input phase space trajectory `Y`'s length, in order to average the conditional
  variances and neighborhood sizes (read algorithm description) to produce `L`.
* `K = 3`: the amount of nearest neighbors considered, in order to compute σ_k^2
  (read algorithm description).
  If given a vector, minimum result over all `k ∈ K` is returned.
* `metric = Euclidean()`: metric used for finding nearest neigbhors in the input
  phase space trajectory `Y.
* `w = 1`: Theiler window (neighbors in time with index `w` close to the point,
  that are excluded from being true neighbors). `w=0` means to exclude only the
  point itself, and no temporal neighbors.
* `Tw = 40`: The time horizon (in sampling units) up to which E_k^2 gets computed
  and averaged over (read algorithm description).
